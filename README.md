# movieBot - a Messenger Chatbot

This is a small project that I had in my Chatbot & Recommendation Systems course. In pairs, we had to design a chatbot that knows everything about the movies you ask him about. To understand the subject and instructions, take a look to the [movieBot_instructions](https://github.com/kevinnclas/movieBot/blob/main/MovieBot_instructions.pdf) file.  
We use severals tools to accomplish this project. First, we used [Facebook for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) to create our chatbot app. Then we used [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) as a plateform for our chatbot development and that lets you easily create text or voice based bots on your preferred messaging platform. Finally, we used [themoviedb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) that our chatbot uses for searching several informations about the movies.  </br></br>
For any questions, don't hesitate to contact me or my collegue, we will try our best to enlight you !
